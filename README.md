# Orchard-LimitImages
An Orchard module that provides a token to downsize images larger than a certain size, for example to use in an rss feed. Makes use of ImageResizer's Url API.  

For example, to limit the image width in the body of your RSS feed, add the RSS part to your content type and input {Text.LimitImages:560} in the description field.
